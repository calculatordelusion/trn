const routeFaqs = [
  { q: "What are the most popular train routes in Pakistan?", a: "The most popular Pakistan Railways routes by passenger volume are: Karachi to Lahore (served by 12+ trains daily including Tezgam, Green Line, Karakoram Express, and Business Express), Lahore to Rawalpindi (8+ trains with 4-5 hour journey time), Karachi to Peshawar (6+ trains including the famous Khyber Mail covering 1,558 km), and Lahore to Multan (10+ trains). These routes connect Pakistan's major population centers and carry millions of passengers every year." },
  { q: "What is the longest train route in Pakistan?", a: "The longest train route in Pakistan is the Karachi to Peshawar corridor, covering approximately 1,687 kilometers on the Main Line. The Khyber Mail (1UP/2DN) operates on the full route, taking approximately 30 hours to complete the journey. This historic route passes through all four provinces of Pakistan and stops at major cities including Hyderabad, Sukkur, Multan, Lahore, and Rawalpindi before reaching Peshawar." },
  { q: "How do I choose the best train for my route?", a: "When choosing a train, consider: (1) Journey duration — express trains are faster but cost more. (2) Coach class — AC Parlor for luxury, Economy for budget travel. (3) Departure time — overnight trains are ideal for long journeys, saving you a hotel night. (4) Running days — not all trains operate daily; check the schedule. (5) Punctuality record — premium trains like Green Line and Business Express maintain better on-time performance. Use our Journey Planner to compare all available options." },
  { q: "Are there connecting routes available?", a: "Yes, many routes require connections at major junction stations. Common connection points include Lahore Junction (for east-west routes), Sukkur/Rohri Junction (for Karachi-Quetta connections via Bolan Mail), Rawalpindi (for Islamabad connections and northbound travel), and Khanewal Junction (for routes branching toward Multan and southern Punjab). When planning connecting journeys, allow at least 2-3 hours between trains for potential delays." },
  { q: "Which routes offer AC (air-conditioned) trains?", a: "AC trains operate on all major routes in Pakistan. The Green Line Express offers premium AC service on the Karachi–Islamabad route with reclining seats, meal service, and WiFi. Tezgam, Karakoram Express, Business Express, and Shalimar Express all offer AC Standard and AC Parlor coaches. AC coaches include comfortable seating, blankets, pillows, and complimentary meals on premium services. Economy AC is also available on select trains." },
  { q: "How can I track trains on a specific route in real-time?", a: "To track trains on any route in real-time, visit our Live Train Tracker page. You can filter by route or search for specific trains by name or number. Each train shows its current GPS position, speed, delay status, and estimated arrival times at upcoming stations. Data updates automatically every 5 seconds, giving you the most accurate tracking information available for Pakistan Railways." },
  { q: "What is the fastest train route in Pakistan?", a: "The fastest train route in Pakistan is the Lahore to Rawalpindi corridor. Premium trains like Business Express and Green Line complete this 290 km journey in approximately 4 hours, reaching speeds of up to 120 km/h on upgraded track sections. The Karachi to Lahore journey on Green Line takes about 18 hours covering 1,228 km, making it the fastest option on the main trunk route." },
  { q: "How many railway stations are there in Pakistan?", a: "Pakistan Railways operates 342+ major railway stations across its network spanning approximately 7,791 kilometers of track. Major junction stations include Lahore Junction (the busiest), Karachi Cantt, Rawalpindi, Multan Cantt, Faisalabad, Peshawar Cantt, Quetta, and Sukkur Junction. Each station serves different train types — express trains stop only at major stations while passenger trains serve all stops along the route." },
  { q: "What is the most scenic train route in Pakistan?", a: "The Quetta–Peshawar route through the Bolan Pass is considered the most scenic, with breathtaking mountain views, tunnels, and bridges through Balochistan's rugged terrain. The Karachi–Quetta route via Sibi offers dramatic landscapes including the famous Chappar Rift. For Punjab plains scenery, the Lahore–Multan corridor passes through lush agricultural heartland." },
  { q: "Are there direct trains from Karachi to Islamabad?", a: "Yes, multiple trains run directly from Karachi to Rawalpindi/Islamabad including Green Line Express (fastest at ~16 hours), Business Express, Tezgam, and Karakoram Express. Rawalpindi station serves as the railway gateway to Islamabad, located about 15 km from the capital. All these trains continue to or originate from other major cities." },
  { q: "Which route has the most trains per day?", a: "The Lahore–Rawalpindi corridor has the highest train frequency with 12+ daily services in each direction. The Karachi–Lahore main trunk route follows closely with 10+ daily trains. Lahore–Multan also sees 8+ services daily. These high-frequency corridors serve the densely populated Punjab region." },
  { q: "Do train routes change during monsoon season?", a: "Yes, during heavy monsoon rains (July–September), some routes may experience temporary diversions or suspensions, particularly in Sindh and southern Punjab due to flooding. Track sections near rivers and low-lying areas are most affected. Check our Live Tracker for real-time route status during monsoon season." },
  { q: "Can I travel from Pakistan to India by train?", a: "The Samjhauta Express (Lahore–Attari) operated between Pakistan and India but has been suspended since 2019. The Thar Express (Karachi–Jodhpur via Munabao) also operated intermittently. Currently, no cross-border train services are operational. Check official announcements for any resumption of services." },
  { q: "What are junction stations and why are they important?", a: "Junction stations are where two or more railway lines meet, allowing passengers to change trains for different destinations. Key junctions include Lahore Junction, Khanewal Junction, Sukkur/Rohri Junction, Lala Musa Junction, and Kotri Junction. Planning connections through junctions is essential for reaching destinations not on direct routes." },
  { q: "How are train routes numbered in Pakistan?", a: "Trains are numbered with UP (odd numbers like 1UP, 3UP) for south-to-north or west-to-east direction, and DN (even numbers like 2DN, 4DN) for the reverse. Lower numbers generally indicate higher priority trains. The same train has different numbers for each direction — e.g., Khyber Mail is 1UP (Peshawar→Karachi) and 2DN (Karachi→Peshawar)." },
  { q: "Which routes are being upgraded under CPEC?", a: "The ML-1 (Main Line 1) upgrade under CPEC is a $6.8 billion project to upgrade the entire 1,733 km Karachi–Peshawar corridor. Phase 1 covers the Multan–Sukkur section (459 km). The upgrade will increase maximum speeds from 100 to 160 km/h, add double tracking, modern signaling, and new stations. Completion is expected by 2028-2030." },
