const ticketFaqs = [
  { q: "How can I book Pakistan Railway tickets online?", a: "You can book tickets through the official Pakistan Railways website (pak-railways.gov.pk) or via the Pakistan Railways mobile app. Create an account, search for your train, select your preferred class, choose your seats, and pay using credit/debit card, JazzCash, Easypaisa, or bank transfer. E-tickets are delivered instantly to your email and can be shown on your phone." },
  { q: "What is the cheapest train class in Pakistan?", a: "Economy Class is the most affordable option, with fares starting from around PKR 350-500 for short distances like Karachi to Hyderabad or Lahore to Faisalabad. Prices vary based on route length and train type — Passenger trains are cheaper than Express trains on the same route." },
  { q: "What is the cancellation policy for train tickets?", a: "Tickets cancelled 24+ hours before departure get a full refund minus a small processing fee (around Rs. 50-100). Cancellations within 24 hours receive a 50% refund. No refund is available after the train has departed. Railway-cancelled trains always get a full refund at any booking counter with no deductions." },
  { q: "Are there any discounts available on train tickets?", a: "Yes! Pakistan Railways offers several discounts: Students get 25-50% off with valid student ID, senior citizens (60+) get 25% off, disabled persons get 50% off with a disability certificate, children aged 3-12 travel at half fare, and children under 3 travel free (without a separate seat). Season tickets for regular commuters also provide significant savings." },
  { q: "What is the difference between AC Standard and AC Business?", a: "AC Business offers wider seats with more recline, complimentary meals, bottled water, and priority boarding. AC Standard has air conditioning with standard reclining seats but fewer premium amenities. AC Business coaches are typically newer and better maintained, making them worth the upgrade on long-distance journeys." },
  { q: "What are the different coach classes in Pakistan Railways?", a: "Pakistan Railways offers 6 travel classes: Economy (fan-cooled basic seating), Business (padded reclining seats), AC Standard (air-conditioned comfortable seating), AC Business (premium AC with meals), AC Sleeper (sleeping berths for overnight travel), and Parlor Car (luxury individual pods with entertainment). Not all classes are available on every train." },
  { q: "Can I change my train ticket to a different date?", a: "Date changes are possible at booking counters, subject to seat availability. Visit the station counter with your original ticket and CNIC at least 6 hours before your scheduled departure. A small change fee of Rs. 50-100 may apply. Online tickets can sometimes be changed through the e-ticketing portal." },
  { q: "What happens if I miss my train?", a: "If you miss your train, the ticket becomes invalid and no refund is given. However, if the train was significantly delayed (30+ minutes past scheduled departure), you can request a full refund at the station counter. Always use our Live Train Tracker to check your train's real-time status before leaving for the station." },
  { q: "Do I need to carry a printed ticket?", a: "For online bookings, you can show the e-ticket on your phone along with your CNIC. For counter bookings, you must carry the physical ticket. It's recommended to keep a screenshot of your e-ticket in case of network issues at the station. Ticket inspectors may also verify your identity during the journey." },
  { q: "How early should I arrive at the station?", a: "Arrive at least 30-45 minutes before departure for express/AC trains, and 15-20 minutes for local/passenger trains. During peak seasons (Eid, summer holidays), arrive 1 hour early to find your coach and seat. Check platform assignments on the station display boards upon arrival." },
  { q: "Are there group booking discounts?", a: "Pakistan Railways offers group rates for parties of 20 or more traveling together. Contact the nearest major station booking office or call Pakistan Railways helpline to arrange group bookings. Group discounts typically range from 10-25% depending on route and class." },
  { q: "Can I buy tickets at any railway station?", a: "You can buy tickets at all major stations with computerized booking counters. Tickets are available up to 30 days in advance. Smaller stations may only have manual ticket windows with limited train options. For the best availability, book online or at major junction stations like Lahore, Karachi Cantt, or Rawalpindi." },
  { q: "Is there a refund for unused return tickets?", a: "Yes, unused return journey tickets can be refunded at any booking counter. The same cancellation policy applies — full refund minus processing fee if cancelled 24+ hours before the return journey departure. Keep both legs of the ticket for refund processing." },
  { q: "Do ticket prices increase during Eid?", a: "Pakistan Railways does not officially increase base fares during Eid, but special Eid trains may have different pricing. The real challenge is availability — tickets sell out weeks in advance for popular routes during Eid ul-Fitr and Eid ul-Adha. Book as early as possible (15-30 days ahead)." },
  { q: "Can I upgrade my ticket class after boarding?", a: "In-train upgrades are sometimes possible if higher-class seats are available. Speak to the train conductor who may allow an upgrade upon payment of the fare difference. This is not guaranteed and depends on seat availability. For guaranteed upgrades, visit the booking counter before departure." },
  { q: "What is the fare for Karachi to Lahore journey?", a: "Karachi to Lahore fares range from Rs. 1,800 (Economy) to Rs. 9,000 (AC Business) depending on train and class. Green Line AC Business costs around Rs. 8,000-9,000, while Tezgam Economy is approximately Rs. 1,800. See our complete fare chart above for all route prices." },
