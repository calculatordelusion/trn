            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
              Pakistan Railways, established in 1861 during British colonial rule, operates one of the largest rail networks in South Asia. With over <strong className="text-foreground">7,791 kilometers of track</strong> spanning all four provinces and covering <strong className="text-foreground">342+ stations</strong>, the network carries millions of passengers annually across routes ranging from 1.5 hours (Wazirabad–Sialkot) to 34 hours (Karachi–Peshawar on the Awam Express).
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-foreground">How the Timetable Is Structured</h3>
            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              Pakistan Railways classifies its 164+ trains into three main categories: <strong className="text-foreground">AC Premium</strong> (Green Line Express, Shalimar Express, Pak Business Express), <strong className="text-foreground">Express</strong> (Tezgam, Khyber Mail, Karakoram Express, Pakistan Express, Allama Iqbal Express, Hazara Express), and <strong className="text-foreground">Passenger/Shuttle</strong> (local and regional services stopping at every station). AC Premium trains offer the fastest journey times and air-conditioned coaches, while Passenger trains are the most affordable but significantly slower.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-foreground">The Main Line 1 (ML-1) Backbone</h3>
            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              The <strong className="text-foreground">Main Line 1 (ML-1)</strong> is Pakistan's most critical rail corridor, stretching 1,726 km from Karachi to Peshawar via Hyderabad, Sukkur, Multan, Lahore, and Rawalpindi. It carries approximately 75% of all rail passenger traffic. Major trains operating on this corridor include the Green Line Express (18h Karachi–Islamabad), Tezgam (22h 50m Karachi–Rawalpindi), Khyber Mail (30h 30m Karachi–Peshawar), and Awam Express (34h Karachi–Peshawar). The ML-1 upgrade under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) aims to increase speeds from the current 65-105 km/h to 160 km/h.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-foreground">Karachi to Lahore: The Most Popular Route</h3>
            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              The Karachi–Lahore corridor (approximately 1,230 km) sees the highest demand. In 2026, daily options include the <strong className="text-foreground">Green Line Express</strong> (departing Karachi 16:00, arrives Lahore en route to Islamabad), <strong className="text-foreground">Pak Business Express 33UP</strong> (19:00 departure, 14:00 arrival, 19 hours), <strong className="text-foreground">Shalimar Express 27UP</strong> (15:30, 20 hours), <strong className="text-foreground">Millat Express 17UP</strong> (20:00, 20 hours), <strong className="text-foreground">Karakoram Express 41UP</strong> (15:30, 21 hours), and <strong className="text-foreground">Fareed Express 37UP</strong> (22:30, 21 hours). Economy fares range from Rs. 1,100 to Rs. 1,500, while AC Business class can cost Rs. 4,500 to Rs. 8,500 depending on the train.

            <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-foreground">Lahore to Rawalpindi/Islamabad: The Busiest Short Corridor</h3>
            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              The 288 km Lahore–Rawalpindi section is Pakistan's busiest short-distance rail corridor. The <strong className="text-foreground">Subak Kharam 103UP</strong> (08:00 departure, 12:30 arrival) and <strong className="text-foreground">Islamabad Express 107UP</strong> (22:30 departure, 03:00 arrival) are the dedicated services taking approximately 4 hours 30 minutes. Additionally, most Karachi-bound long-distance trains traverse this corridor, giving travelers 10+ daily options. The journey passes through Gujranwala, Wazirabad, Lala Musa, Jhelum, and Gujar Khan.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-foreground">Understanding UP and DN Designations</h3>
            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              Every Pakistan Railways train carries a directional suffix: <strong className="text-foreground">UP</strong> (traveling south-to-north or west-to-east) and <strong className="text-foreground">DN (Down)</strong> (traveling north-to-south or east-to-west). For example, Tezgam 7UP runs Karachi → Rawalpindi, while 8DN runs Rawalpindi → Karachi. Odd-numbered trains are always UP direction; even-numbered are always DN. This system dates back to British-era railway conventions where trains traveling toward the national capital were designated "UP."

            <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-foreground">Fog Season: December to February</h3>
            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              The most significant schedule disruption every year occurs during <strong className="text-foreground">fog season (December–February)</strong> in Punjab and upper Sindh. Dense fog reduces visibility to near-zero levels, forcing trains to reduce speeds to 15-30 km/h. Morning departures from Lahore, Faisalabad, Sahiwal, and Multan are most affected, with typical delays of 3-6 hours. Pakistan Railways issues revised fog timetables during this period, with some trains departing 1-2 hours earlier to compensate. Travelers are strongly advised to choose afternoon departures (after 14:00) from Punjab stations during winter for the most reliable journey.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-foreground">Eid Season Special Schedules</h3>
            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              During Eid-ul-Fitr and Eid-ul-Adha, Pakistan Railways operates <strong className="text-foreground">special Eid trains</strong> on high-demand routes and adds extra coaches to regular services. Popular routes like Karachi–Lahore, Lahore–Rawalpindi, and Multan–Lahore see a surge in demand 5-7 days before each Eid. Tickets for express trains often sell out 15-20 days in advance. Pakistan Railways typically announces Eid schedule changes 2-3 weeks before the holiday. Travelers are advised to book tickets as soon as the 30-day booking window opens using the RABTA app.
