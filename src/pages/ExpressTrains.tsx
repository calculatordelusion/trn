const expressFaqs = [
  { q: "What is an Express train in Pakistan Railways?", a: "Express trains are faster long-distance services that skip many smaller stations to reduce journey time. They typically offer better amenities including AC coaches, dining cars, and more comfortable seating compared to passenger trains. Express trains are the backbone of Pakistan's inter-city rail travel." },
  { q: "How are Express trains different from Mail trains?", a: "Mail trains were historically used to carry post/mail alongside passengers and are slightly slower than Express trains, making a few more stops. Today, the distinction is mostly historical as both offer similar services and comfort levels. Examples of Mail trains include Khyber Mail and Tezgam." },
  { q: "Which is the fastest express train in Pakistan?", a: "The Business Express and Green Line Express are among the fastest, covering Karachi to Lahore in about 15-16 hours with minimal stops. They use well-maintained track sections and offer premium AC business class service with complimentary meals." },
  { q: "What is the difference between Express and Passenger trains?", a: "Express trains are faster long-distance services that make fewer stops, offer multiple coach classes (Economy, Business, AC Standard, AC Business, Sleeper), and run on fixed schedules. Passenger trains are slower, stop at every station, are more affordable, and primarily serve shorter routes and rural areas." },
  { q: "Do Express trains have dining facilities?", a: "Yes, most Express trains have pantry/dining cars serving hot meals, snacks, tea, and beverages throughout the journey. AC class passengers on premium trains like Green Line and Business Express get complimentary meals included in their ticket price." },
  { q: "How far in advance should I book Express train tickets?", a: "For popular routes like Karachi-Lahore or during holidays (Eid, summer), book 15-30 days in advance. AC classes fill up faster than economy, so plan accordingly. Online booking is available 24/7 through the official Pakistan Railways website." },
  { q: "Are Express trains air-conditioned?", a: "Most Express trains offer multiple AC classes including AC Business, AC Parlor, AC Sleeper, and AC Standard. Economy class is fan-cooled but still comfortable for budget travelers. Not all classes are available on every train." },
  { q: "How do I track an express train in real-time?", a: "Visit our Live Trains page or search for your train by name or number. You'll see the exact GPS position, current speed, delay status, and estimated arrival times at all upcoming stations. Our data refreshes every 5 seconds for real-time accuracy." },
  { q: "Do express trains run on time?", a: "Pakistan Railways express trains have an average on-time performance of about 60-70%. Delays are common due to track conditions, weather, and operational issues. Use our Live Train Tracker to check real-time delay status before heading to the station." },
  { q: "Can I book express train tickets online?", a: "Yes, express train tickets can be booked online through the official Pakistan Railways website (pak-railways.gov.pk) or mobile app. You can pay via credit/debit cards, JazzCash, or Easypaisa. E-tickets are delivered instantly to your email." },
  { q: "Which express trains have sleeping berths?", a: "AC Sleeper class is available on major overnight express trains including Karakoram Express, Tezgam, Khyber Mail, and Allama Iqbal Express. Sleeper berths come with bedding, blankets, and pillows for comfortable overnight travel." },
  { q: "What is the cheapest express train?", a: "The Shalimar Express offers the most affordable fares on the Karachi-Lahore route with economy class starting around Rs. 1,500-1,800. Passenger trains are even cheaper but significantly slower. For the best value, compare fares on our Ticket Pricing page." },
  { q: "What amenities are available in AC Business class?", a: "AC Business class offers wide reclining seats with extra legroom, full air conditioning, complimentary hot meals and beverages, blankets and pillows, charging points, and priority boarding. On Green Line Express, WiFi is also available. AC Business coaches are typically the newest in the fleet." },
  { q: "How many express trains run daily in Pakistan?", a: "Pakistan Railways operates approximately 74+ express and AC trains daily across its network. This includes Super Express (Green Line, Business Express), Standard Express (Karakoram, Shalimar), and Mail trains (Khyber Mail, Tezgam). Not all run daily — check our schedule for specific running days." },
  { q: "Can I carry luggage on express trains?", a: "Yes, each passenger is allowed up to 40 kg of luggage free of charge on express trains. Luggage is stored in overhead racks or under seats. For excess baggage, a nominal fee is charged per kg. Large items like bicycles or furniture require separate booking through the parcels department." },
  { q: "Are there women-only coaches on express trains?", a: "Some express trains designate specific coaches or sections for women travelers, particularly Economy class. Check with station staff when boarding. Premium AC classes are generally mixed seating. Families are also given preference in certain coach assignments." },
  { q: "What happens if an express train is cancelled?", a: "If Pakistan Railways cancels a train, passengers receive a full refund at any booking counter with no deductions. Online ticket holders get refunds credited to their original payment method within 7-14 business days. Alternate trains may be arranged depending on the route." },
