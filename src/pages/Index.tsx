  const faqs = [
    { q: "How can I track my train in Pakistan right now?", a: "Open Track My Train, type your train's name or number into the search bar, and tap the result. You'll instantly see the train's live GPS position on the map, its current speed, how many minutes late it is (if any), and updated arrival estimates for every upcoming station. The page refreshes automatically every 5 seconds, so you can leave it open and watch progress in real-time without reloading." },
    { q: "What details are shown when I track a train?", a: "Each train's live page displays: exact GPS coordinates plotted on an interactive map, real-time speed in km/h, accumulated delay in minutes, a progress bar showing how far along the route the train has traveled, and an estimated time of arrival (ETA) at the next station and all remaining stops. We also show the official schedule alongside the live data so you can compare expected vs. actual timings at a glance." },
    { q: "How reliable are the delay and ETA estimates?", a: "Our algorithm cross-references the train's actual GPS position with the official Pakistan Railways timetable and calculates accumulated delay. Accuracy is typically ±3 to 5 minutes for most services. ETAs adjust dynamically as the train speeds up, slows down, or waits at a signal stop, so the estimate gets more precise the closer the train is to your station." },
    { q: "Do I need to download an app or create an account?", a: "No — Track My Train works entirely in your browser. Open trackmytrain.pk on any phone, tablet, or computer and start tracking instantly. There's no app to install, no account to create, and no personal information collected. The site is lightweight and optimized to load fast even on 2G or 3G mobile data, so you can check your train anywhere in Pakistan." },
    { q: "Which trains are covered by Track My Train?", a: "We cover every active Pakistan Railways passenger service — that includes Express trains like Tezgam, Karakoram, Shalimar, and Allama Iqbal; premium AC services like Green Line Express and Business Express; and local Passenger trains on branch lines. In total, our system monitors 164+ scheduled services running across 342+ stations from Karachi to Peshawar and Quetta to Lahore." },
    { q: "Is Track My Train the same as Pakistan Railways' official website?", a: "No. Track My Train (trackmytrain.pk) is a fully independent platform built by a team of developers and railway enthusiasts. We are not affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected to Pakistan Railways or any government agency. Our goal is to make train information more accessible and user-friendly for everyday passengers. For official ticket bookings and reservations, please use Pakistan Railways' own channels or call the helpline 117." },
    { q: "How is 'Find My Train' different from regular tracking?", a: "Regular tracking lets you search for a train by name or number. 'Find My Train' flips it around — you grant location access on your phone, and our system matches your GPS coordinates against all active train routes to figure out which train you're currently riding. This is especially handy when you boarded a connecting service and aren't sure of the train number, or when you want to share your live position with family waiting at the station." },
    { q: "Can I plan a complete journey between two stations?", a: "Absolutely. Our Journey Planner lets you pick any departure and arrival station from the full Pakistan Railways network. It then searches through all 164+ trains — including intermediate stops — and shows you every direct option sorted by travel time. For each result you see departure time, arrival time, total duration, train type (Express/AC/Passenger), and running days, so you can compare and pick the best fit." },
    { q: "Does Track My Train work during festivals and holidays?", a: "Yes. In fact, we're most useful during Eid, national holidays, and summer rush when delays are more common. Our live GPS data captures exactly what's happening on the ground — whether a train is stuck at a crossing, delayed at a junction, or running on schedule. We recommend checking 30–60 minutes before you head to the station during peak periods so you can adjust your plans accordingly." },
    { q: "How does Track My Train make money if it's free?", a: "The platform sustains itself through contextual advertisements displayed on the site. We do not charge users, sell personal data, or gate any features behind a paywall. Every tool — live tracking, journey planner, schedule lookup, delay alerts — is free and always will be. Our philosophy is that essential public transport information should be available to everyone without barriers." },
    { q: "What is the fastest train from Karachi to Lahore?", a: "The Green Line Express is the fastest train on the Karachi–Lahore route, completing the journey in approximately 18 hours. It offers AC Business, AC Standard, and Economy class seating with modern amenities. Other popular options include the Tezgam (22 hours), Karakoram Express (22 hours), and Business Express (20 hours). You can compare all Karachi–Lahore trains side by side on our Journey Planner page." },
    { q: "How do I check Pakistan Railways ticket prices online?", a: "Visit our Ticket Pricing page to see fares for all major routes. Prices vary by train type and class — Economy class starts from Rs. 300 for short routes, while AC Business class on premium Express trains can cost Rs. 5,000–9,000 for long-distance journeys like Karachi to Peshawar. Our fare comparison tool shows prices for every class so you can pick what fits your budget." },
    { q: "Can I track the Green Line Express in real-time?", a: "Yes! The Green Line Express (Train 101UP/102DN) between Islamabad and Karachi is fully tracked on our platform. Open the Live Tracker, search 'Green Line', and you'll see its exact GPS position, current speed, delay status, and ETAs for all stations including Lahore, Multan, Sukkur, and Hyderabad. The Green Line page also has dedicated schedule and fare information." },
    { q: "What stations have WiFi and VIP lounges in Pakistan?", a: "Lahore Junction is the most well-equipped station with WiFi, VIP lounge, food court, ATM, parking, and medical aid. Other major stations like Rawalpindi, Karachi Cantt, and Multan Cantt offer food courts, ATMs, and parking. You can explore all station amenities on our Stations Directory — each station page lists every available facility including waiting rooms, ticket counters, restrooms, and accessibility features." },
    { q: "How accurate is the Find My Train GPS feature?", a: "Find My Train uses your phone's built-in GPS to detect your position and cross-references it against all active train routes in our database. Accuracy depends on your phone's GPS chip and signal quality, but in most cases it identifies the correct train within 30 seconds. It works best when the train is moving (not stationary at a platform where multiple trains may be present). For best results, ensure location services are enabled and you have a clear sky view." },
    { q: "Does Track My Train show train delays during fog season?", a: "Yes, and fog season (December–February) is when our platform is most valuable. Pakistan Railways trains frequently experience 2–8 hour delays during heavy fog in Punjab and upper Sindh. Our live GPS tracking shows you the actual position and accumulated delay for every train, so you can avoid arriving at the station hours early only to wait in the cold. We recommend checking delays 1–2 hours before your scheduled departure during winter months." },
    { q: "What is the cheapest train from Karachi to Lahore?", a: "The cheapest options are the Tezgam Express and Karakoram Express, both offering Economy class seats for approximately Rs. 1,500. The journey takes 20–22 hours. For slightly more comfort, AC Standard class on these trains costs Rs. 3,000–3,500. If budget is your primary concern, the Tezgam is the most popular choice among daily commuters and students." },
    { q: "How do I get a student discount on Pakistan Railways?", a: "Students enrolled in recognized Pakistani institutions receive a 25% discount on all ticket classes. To avail this, present your valid student ID card at the booking counter along with your CNIC. The discount applies to all train types including Express and AC services. Some trains also offer special student concessions during summer break (June–August) — ask at the counter for current promotions." },
    { q: "Can I carry luggage on Pakistan Railways trains?", a: "Yes. Each passenger is allowed up to 40 kg of free luggage on Express and Mail trains, and 30 kg on Passenger services. Excess luggage is charged at Rs. 2–5 per kg depending on the route. Luggage should be stored under your berth (Sleeper class) or in the overhead rack. For very large items like furniture or motorcycles, use the separate freight/parcel service available at major stations." },
    { q: "Is there food available on Pakistan Railways trains?", a: "Yes. Premium trains like the Green Line Express and Business Express offer on-board catering with meals included in AC Business class tickets. On other trains, vendors board at major stations selling tea, snacks, biryani, and cold drinks. Lahore Junction, Multan Cantt, and Sukkur stations are known for their platform food stalls. We recommend carrying your own water and snacks for long journeys as vendors may run out during peak hours." },
    { q: "How can I check if my train is running today?", a: "Open Track My Train and search for your train by name or number. If the train shows a 'LIVE' badge with a green dot, it is currently running and you can see its exact GPS position. If it shows 'Active' without a live badge, it is scheduled to run today but hasn't departed yet. If it shows 'Inactive', the service may be suspended or doesn't run on this day of the week. You can also check our Schedule page for running days." },
    { q: "What happens if Pakistan Railways cancels my train?", a: "If Pakistan Railways cancels a scheduled service, passengers are entitled to a full refund or can transfer their ticket to the next available train on the same route. Cancellations are rare and usually occur due to extreme weather (floods, heavy fog) or infrastructure emergencies. Our platform shows cancellation notices when available. For refund processing, visit the booking counter at any major station with your ticket and CNIC within 72 hours of the cancellation." },
