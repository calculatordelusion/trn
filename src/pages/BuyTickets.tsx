  { q: "How do I book Pakistan Railways tickets online in 2026?", a: "You can book tickets online through the official RABTA app (available on Android and iOS) or the Pakistan Railways website at pakrailways.gov.pk. Create an account using your CNIC number, search for trains between your stations, select your preferred class, and pay using JazzCash, Easypaisa, or a debit/credit card. Your e-ticket is sent to your phone — no printout needed." },
  { q: "What is the RABTA app and is it official?", a: "RABTA is the officially authorized ticketing application by Pakistan Railways, developed by Easyway Innovations. It's available on Google Play Store and Apple App Store. It allows you to search trains, book tickets, check schedules, and manage reservations. It replaced the older Pak Rail Live booking system in 2024." },
  { q: "Can I book train tickets without a CNIC?", a: "No, a valid CNIC (Computerized National Identity Card) is required for all Pakistan Railways ticket bookings — both online and at counters. For foreign nationals, a valid passport number can be used instead. Children under 3 travel free without a ticket; ages 3-12 require a half-fare ticket booked under a parent's CNIC." },
  { q: "How far in advance can I book train tickets?", a: "You can book Pakistan Railways tickets up to 30 days in advance through the RABTA app, online portal, or at station counters. For peak seasons (Eid, summer holidays, December), booking 15-30 days early is strongly recommended as popular trains like Green Line Express and Tezgam sell out quickly." },
  { q: "What payment methods are accepted for online booking?", a: "Pakistan Railways online booking accepts JazzCash, Easypaisa, and debit/credit cards (Visa, Mastercard). JazzCash and Easypaisa are the most popular methods, requiring just your mobile wallet PIN to complete payment. Bank transfers are not directly supported for online bookings." },
  { q: "Can I cancel my train ticket and get a refund?", a: "Yes. Cancellation more than 24 hours before departure: full refund minus Rs. 50 processing fee. Between 4-24 hours: 75% refund. Between 2-4 hours: 50% refund. Less than 2 hours or after departure: no refund. Refunds are processed to your original payment method within 7-10 business days." },
  { q: "Do I need to print my e-ticket?", a: "No, you do not need to print your e-ticket. The digital ticket on your phone (in the RABTA app or the confirmation SMS/email) is sufficient. The ticket checker (TTE) will scan or verify your ticket using your CNIC number and booking reference. However, keeping a screenshot is recommended in case of network issues on the train." },
  { q: "What is the difference between reserved and unreserved tickets?", a: "Reserved tickets guarantee you a specific seat/berth number in your chosen coach class. Unreserved tickets (available on Passenger trains only) allow boarding but without a guaranteed seat — you sit wherever space is available. Express and premium trains like Green Line only offer reserved seats." },
  { q: "Can I change my train or date after booking?", a: "Date changes are allowed once, up to 24 hours before departure, subject to seat availability on the new date. You cannot change the train type, route, or class — you'd need to cancel and rebook. Changes can be made through the RABTA app or at a reservation counter with your booking reference." },
  { q: "Are there student or senior citizen discounts?", a: "Yes. Students with a valid college/university ID get 25% off on Economy and Business class. Senior citizens (60+) receive a 25% concession on all classes with a valid CNIC. Disabled persons with a disability certificate get 50% off. Children aged 3-12 travel at 50% fare. Children under 3 travel free." },
  { q: "What happens if my train is cancelled after I've booked?", a: "If Pakistan Railways cancels a train, you receive a full 100% refund automatically to your original payment method within 5-7 business days. Alternatively, you can transfer your booking to the next available train on the same route at no extra cost. Contact the RABTA helpline (117) or visit the station counter." },
  { q: "Can I book tickets for someone else?", a: "Yes, you can book tickets for other passengers using your account. You'll need their full name and CNIC number. The passenger must carry their original CNIC during travel for verification by the ticket checker. You can book up to 6 tickets per transaction." },
  { q: "Is it cheaper to book online or at the counter?", a: "The fare is the same whether you book online or at the counter. However, online booking saves you the trip to the station and waiting in queues. Occasionally, Pakistan Railways runs promotional discounts exclusive to online/app bookings — typically 5-10% off on select routes." },
  { q: "What should I do if my online payment fails but money is deducted?", a: "If your payment is deducted but the ticket isn't confirmed, wait 30 minutes — the system often auto-reverses failed transactions. If not resolved, contact the RABTA helpline at 117 with your transaction ID and CNIC. You can also email complaints@pakrailways.gov.pk. Refunds for failed transactions typically process within 3-5 business days." },
  { q: "Can I book train tickets at the station on the same day?", a: "Yes, same-day booking is available at station counters subject to seat availability. However, for popular Express trains, same-day seats are rarely available. Passenger trains and less popular routes usually have same-day availability. Arrive at least 1 hour before departure to allow time for ticketing." },
  { q: "What classes are available for online booking?", a: "All classes are available for online booking: Economy, Business, AC Standard, AC Business, AC Sleeper, and Parlor Car. However, not all trains offer all classes. Green Line Express offers AC Business, AC Standard, AC Sleeper, and Economy. Passenger trains typically only offer Economy class." },

            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
              Purchasing train tickets in Pakistan has undergone a significant digital transformation since the introduction of the <strong className="text-foreground">e-ticketing system</strong> by the Ministry of Railways. What was once a process that required hours of waiting at crowded station counters can now be completed from your smartphone in under five minutes. This guide covers every aspect of the booking experience — from initial registration to boarding your train.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-foreground">Understanding the RABTA Booking System</h3>
            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              <strong className="text-foreground">RABTA</strong> is the officially authorized ticketing platform for Pakistan Railways, replacing the older reservation systems. Developed by Easyway Innovations, the RABTA app is available on both Google Play Store (Android) and Apple App Store (iOS), with over 1 million downloads. The platform handles everything from seat selection and payment processing to cancellation and refund management. The companion website at <strong className="text-foreground">pakrailways.gov.pk/buy</strong> offers the same functionality for desktop users.
            </p>
            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              The system requires a <strong className="text-foreground">valid CNIC (Computerized National Identity Card)</strong> for registration and booking. This is a security measure that ties each ticket to a verified identity, reducing ticket touting and unauthorized resale. Foreign nationals can use their passport number instead. The registration process involves OTP (One-Time Password) verification sent to your mobile number, ensuring account security.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-foreground">Fare Structure & Class Selection</h3>
            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              Pakistan Railways offers six coach classes, each designed for different comfort levels and budgets. <strong className="text-foreground">Economy Class</strong> (Rs. 350–2,400) provides basic cushioned seating with fan cooling — the most affordable option. <strong className="text-foreground">Business Class</strong> (Rs. 800–4,500) offers reclining seats with more legroom. <strong className="text-foreground">AC Standard</strong> (Rs. 1,200–8,000) is the sweet spot — full air conditioning, comfortable seating, and blankets on overnight trains. <strong className="text-foreground">AC Business</strong> (Rs. 1,800–11,500) is the premium tier with wide luxury seats, complimentary meals, and priority boarding. <strong className="text-foreground">AC Sleeper</strong> (Rs. 2,500–9,000) offers individual berths with bedding for overnight journeys. The rare <strong className="text-foreground">Parlor Car</strong> class is available on select trains like the Business Express.
            </p>
            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              Fares are calculated based on three factors: <strong className="text-foreground">distance traveled</strong> (per-kilometer rate), <strong className="text-foreground">train category</strong> (Express trains cost more than Passenger trains for the same route), and <strong className="text-foreground">coach class</strong>. Premium trains like the <Link to="/green-line-express" className="text-primary hover:underline font-semibold">Green Line Express</Link> charge an additional service premium for their superior amenities.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-foreground">Peak Season Booking Strategy</h3>
            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              The biggest mistake first-time train travelers make is booking too late during peak periods. <strong className="text-foreground">Eid-ul-Fitr</strong> and <strong className="text-foreground">Eid-ul-Adha</strong> are the two highest-demand periods — trains on the Karachi–Lahore, Karachi–Rawalpindi, and Lahore–Peshawar corridors sell out <strong className="text-foreground">15–20 days before the holiday</strong>. Summer holidays (June–July) and December holidays also see elevated demand. The solution is simple: book as soon as the 30-day booking window opens. Set a phone alarm for the exact date your travel window opens and book immediately.
            </p>
            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              During fog season (December–February), Punjab-bound trains frequently experience <strong className="text-foreground">3–8 hour delays</strong>. While this doesn't affect your ticket validity, it does mean you should use our <Link to="/check-delays" className="text-primary hover:underline font-semibold">live delay checker</Link> before heading to the station. An afternoon departure is significantly more reliable than a morning one during this period.
            </p>

              Once you've booked your ticket, use <Link to="/" className="text-primary hover:underline font-semibold">Track My Train</Link> to monitor your train in real time. Our platform shows the <strong className="text-foreground">exact GPS position</strong> of every Pakistan Railways train, updated every 5 seconds. Check the estimated arrival time at your station, current speed, and delay status — all without creating an account or paying a fee. On travel day, this tool eliminates the guesswork of "has my train left yet?" and "how late will it be?"
